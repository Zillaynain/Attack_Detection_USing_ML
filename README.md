# Attack_Detection_USing_ML
We are exploring the CIC-IDS 2017 and IOT-IDS2020 datasets. These datasets contain a wealth of information about network activities and cyberattacks. The aim is to focus on using the power of machine learning and deep learning to build Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that can effectively detect and respond to these attacks.
